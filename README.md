# Driver Attack 
### For generating adversarial patches to fool the Driver State Detection Systems


#### `Main.ipynb` contains the main pipeline
#### `advPatch.ipynb` contains the Black Box adversarial attack patch.
#### `Plots` dir will eventually hold the plots generated.
#### `Model_weights` dir will contain the weights of the model. Since size of these weight files are large the weights will be \n eventually uploaded on drive and download scipt will be added.
#### `data` dir will contain the unzipped version of AUC dataset

# TODO
+ Train the model while cross validating and storing the weights
+ Adv Patch
+ Generate Plots and store `.jpeg` in `plots` dir.
