# Driver Attack 
### For generating adversarial patches to fool the Driver State Detection Systems


#### `Main.ipynb` contains the main pipeline
#### `advPatch.ipynb` contains the Black Box adversarial attack patch.
#### `Plots` dir will eventually hold the plots generated.
#### `Model_weights` dir will contain the weights of the model. Since size of these weight files are large the weights will be eventually uploaded on drive and download scipt will be added.
#### `data` dir will contain the unzipped version of AUC dataset

# TODO
+ Train the model while cross validating and storing the weights
+ Adv Patch
+ Generate Plots and store `.jpeg` in `plots` dir.
+ Add `.zip` file of data to drive and add `download.sh` script in `data` folder for downloading data from drive.
+ The above point for `Model_weights`.
